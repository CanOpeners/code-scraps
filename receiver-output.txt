The transmitter sends these lines every frame:
1. Frame ID - an integer counting up from 1, increments each frame
2. BMP280 Pressure [hPa] - float
3. BMP280 Temperature [°C] - float
4. LM35 Temperature [°C] - float
5. DHT11 Temperature [°C] - float
6. DHT11 Humidity [%] - float

The receiver prints every frame it receives, each one beginning with the line '-- START' and ending with the line '-- END'. In between those lines are lines the transmitter sent.
Additionally, before the lines from the transmitter, but after '-- START', there are two lines:
1. RSSI - integer
2. Frame size in bytes - integer

Sample frame output from the receiver:
-- START
-104

994.34
21.08
21.83
21.50
42.00
-- END
